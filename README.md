# Data-Wrangling-Project
The project demonstrates data wrangling practices focusing on red and white wine quality and pysicochemical properties.
The project used Jupyter Notebooks and Python to perform operations.
The project is provided unzipped though the zipped file contains the data in raw and cleaned formats.
The project was used for a Udacity Nanodegree program for the college WGU.
